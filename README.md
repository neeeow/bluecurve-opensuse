## Authors

## Sources
* The KDE 3 theme was compiled from source using the [redhat-artwork-5.0.8-4.fc6.src.rpm](https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/updates/6/SRPMS/redhat-artwork-5.0.8-4.fc6.src.rpm) Fedora Core 6 package
* The GTK 2 theme & cursors were taken from the [redhat-artwork-5.0.8-4.fc6.x86_64.rpm](https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/updates/6/x86_64/redhat-artwork-5.0.8-4.fc6.x86_64.rpm) Fedora Core 6 package
* The icon set was taken from [here](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1167536) and adapted to change the K Menu icon to the KDE Classic K Menu icon
  * I chose to use this icon set instead of taking it directly from the source RPM as this icon set has been updated to reflect name changes that have occured in the past ~15+ years
